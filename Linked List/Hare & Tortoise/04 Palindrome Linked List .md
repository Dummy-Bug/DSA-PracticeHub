**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of the isPalindrome function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the linked list once to find the midpoint and reverse the second half, and then we compare the elements of the first half with the reversed second half, which requires another traversal.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space for the dummy_node, turtle, and hare pointers. The reversal of the second half of the linked list is done in-place, so no additional space is required.

# C++ Code
```cpp
// Find middle and then reverse the other half of the linked list and check if it is a palindrome.

public:
    /**
     * Checks whether a linked list is a palindrome.
     *
     * @param head The head of the linked list.
     * @return True if the linked list is a palindrome, false otherwise.
