# Python Code

```python

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        """
        Detects the start node of the cycle in a linked list.

        Args:
            head: The head node of the linked list.

        Returns:
            The start node of the cycle if a cycle is present, None otherwise.

        """
        turtle = hare = head

        # Find the meeting point of the turtle and hare within the cycle
        while hare and hare.next:
            turtle = turtle.next
            hare = hare.next.next
            if turtle == hare:
                break
        else:
            return None  # No cycle is present, return None

        turtle = head
        hare = hare

        # Move the turtle and hare at the same speed until they meet at the start of the cycle
        while turtle != hare:
            turtle = turtle.next
            hare = hare.next

        return turtle  # Return the start node of the cycle


```

**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the linked list once to find the meeting point, and then we traverse it again to find the start node of the cycle.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity is O(1) since we are using only two additional pointers, turtle and hare, to detect the cycle. The space usage remains constant regardless of the size of the linked list.

    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;

        // Detect the cycle using the two-pointer approach
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;

            if (slow == fast) {  // Cycle detected
                slow = head;
                // Move slow pointer to the head and advance both pointers at the same pace
                while (slow != fast) {
                    slow = slow->next;
                    fast = fast->next;

            }
