# Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        slow = nums[0]
        fast = nums[nums[0]]

        while slow != fast:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]

        fast = 0
        while slow != fast:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[fast]

        return slow
```

**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of the provided code is O(n), where n is the size of the input vector nums. This is because the algorithm iterates through the elements of nums twice, using two pointers: slow and fast. In the worst case, the pointers will meet after traversing the entire vector, resulting in a linear time complexity.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity of the code is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space.

# C++ Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * Finds the duplicate element in the given vector using Floyd's Algorithm.
     *
     * @param nums: The vector of integers.
     * @return: The duplicate element.
     */
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int slow = nums[0], fast = nums[nums[0]];

        // Find the intersection point of the two pointers
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        }

        fast = 0;
        // Move both pointers at the same pace until they meet at the duplicate element
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
