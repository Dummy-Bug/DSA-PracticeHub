**Time Complexity**
- O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. The method involves finding the midpoint, reversing the second half, and merging the two halves, each of which takes O(N/2) time in the worst case.
findMidpoint:

**Space Complexity**

- Space Complexity: O(1). The method reorders the linked list in-place and does not require any additional space.
