**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of the solve method in this code is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we iterate through each node once.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store temporary variables and create the dummy node. We are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.
