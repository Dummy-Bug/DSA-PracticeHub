**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of the solve function in the provided code is O(log N), where N is the length of the input array nums. This is because the algorithm uses binary search to find the target value in both the increasing and decreasing parts of the bitonic array.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity of the code is O(1), which means it uses constant space. The algorithm does not require any extra data structures that grow with the input size. It performs the search and comparisons directly on the input array without using additional memory.
