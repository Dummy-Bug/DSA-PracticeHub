## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the search method is O(log n), where n is the length of the input nums array. This is because the algorithm performs a binary search, dividing the search space in half at each step. The presence of possible duplicates does not affect the overall time complexity significantly.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm only uses a constant amount of additional space for the variables low, high, mid, and target. It does not require any additional data structures that grow with the input size.
