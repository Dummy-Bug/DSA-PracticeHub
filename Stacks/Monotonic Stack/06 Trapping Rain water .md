### Time Complexity 
- The time complexity of the trap method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array height. This is because the method iterates over the array once in a single pass, and for each element, it performs constant time operations. The while loop inside the for loop may iterate multiple times in total, but each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity of the trap method is O(n) as well. This is because it uses a stack to store the indices of the elements. In the worst case scenario, where the elements in the height array are in non-decreasing order, the stack will contain all the indices. Therefore, the space required by the stack is proportional to the number of elements in the input array, resulting in O(n) space complexity.
