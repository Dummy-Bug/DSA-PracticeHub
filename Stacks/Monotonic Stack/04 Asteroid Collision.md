### Time Complexity
- The method iterates through the asteroids array once, performing constant-time operations for each asteroid.
The while loop inside the iteration only executes in certain cases, such as when there is a collision between positive and negative asteroids.
Overall, the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input array.

### Space Complexity
- The method uses a stack (st) to store the remaining asteroids.
In the worst case, all asteroids in the input array could remain after the collisions, leading to a stack size of n.
Therefore, the space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input array.
