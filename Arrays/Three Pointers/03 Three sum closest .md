**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of the threeSumClosest method is O(n^2), where n is the length of the A array. The outer loop runs for n iterations, and the inner while loop runs in a two-pointer fashion, taking O(n) iterations in the worst case. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm doesn't use any extra space that grows with the input size. It only uses a constant amount of extra space to store some variables during the process.
