# Python Code

```python 

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Iterate through the elements of the nums list
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Swap elements to their correct positions
            while nums[i] < len(nums) and nums[i] != i:
                target_index = nums[i]
                nums[i], nums[target_index] = nums[target_index], nums[i]
        
        # Find the first missing number in the sorted list
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != i:
                return i
        
        # If no missing number found, return the last element as the missing number
        return len(nums)

```

**Time Complexity**
- O(n), where n is the length of the input list nums. This is because we iterate through the list twice: once for swapping elements to their correct positions, and again to find the missing number.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity is O(1) because we don't use any extra space that grows with the input size. We perform the operations in-place on the given list nums, so the space used remains constant regardless of the input size
