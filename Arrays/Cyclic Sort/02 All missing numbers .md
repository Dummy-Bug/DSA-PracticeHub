        """
        Finds the missing numbers in a list of integers.

        Args:
            nums (List[int]): The input list of integers.

        Returns:
            List[int]: The list of missing numbers.

        """
        index = 0
        while index < len(nums):
            # Check if the current number is in its correct position
            if nums[index] != nums[nums[index] - 1]:
                swap_index = nums[index] - 1
                nums[index], nums[swap_index] = nums[swap_index], nums[index]
            else:
                index += 1

        missing_numbers = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # If the number is not in its correct position, it is a missing number
            if nums[i] != i + 1:

```

**Time Complexity**
- O(n), where n is the length of the input list nums. This is because we iterate through the list twice: once to swap the numbers to their correct positions, and once to find the missing numbers.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size. We only use a constant amount of extra space to store the missing numbers.

Overall, the algorithm has an efficient time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
