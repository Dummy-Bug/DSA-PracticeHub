**Time Complexity**
- The algorithm performs a single pass through the given height list, with each step taking constant time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the height list.

**Space Complexity**
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. Hence, the space complexity is O(1).
