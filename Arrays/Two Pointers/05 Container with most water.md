# Python Code

```python

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def maxArea(self, A):
        l = 0  # Left pointer
        r = len(A) - 1  # Right pointer
        area = 0  # Variable to store the maximum area
        
        while l < r:
            # Calculate the area between the current left and right boundaries
            # and update the maximum area if necessary
            area = max(area, min(A[l], A[r]) * (r - l))
            
            if A[l] < A[r]:
                l += 1  # Move the left pointer towards right if the left height is smaller
            else:
                r -= 1  # Move the right pointer towards left if the right height is smaller
        
        return area  # Return the maximum area


```

**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array A.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.
