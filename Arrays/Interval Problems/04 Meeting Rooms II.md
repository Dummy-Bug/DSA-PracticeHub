**Time Complexity**

- The code involves sorting the meetings based on their start times, which takes O(N log N) time complexity. Additionally, we iterate through the sorted meetings once, which takes O(N) time complexity.

- Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, resulting in O(N log N) time complexity.

**Space Cmplexity**

- The space complexity of the code is O(N). We use a min-heap to store the end times of ongoing meetings. In the worst case, all N meetings could be scheduled in separate conference rooms, so the min-heap can have up to N elements
