**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of the rob function in this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list a. This is because the function utilizes memoization to store and retrieve precalculated results, avoiding redundant calculations. Within the helper function, the maximum amount of money is computed for each house, and the results are stored in the temp list. As a result, the maximum amount of money is computed once for each house, resulting in a linear time complexity.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity of the solution is O(n) as well. This is because the temp list is used to store the calculated results for each house. The length of this list is equal to the length of the input list a, so the space required is proportional to the size of the input. Additionally, the recursive calls in the helper function consume space on the call stack, but the maximum depth of recursion is limited to the length of the input list. Therefore, the space complexity is linear in terms of the input size.
