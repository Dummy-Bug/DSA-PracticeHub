**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n) because each cell in the grid is visited once and its result is stored in the memoization table.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity is also O(m * n) because the memoization table is created to store the calculated results for each cell in the grid. The space required is proportional to the size of the grid.
