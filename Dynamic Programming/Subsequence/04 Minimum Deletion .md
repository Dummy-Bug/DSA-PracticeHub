## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the minDistance function in the given code is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of word1 and word2 respectively. This is because the function makes use of dynamic programming to compute the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between word1 and word2. The dynamic programming approach fills in a 2D matrix dp of size (m+1) x (n+1) in a bottom-up manner, iterating through all possible subproblems. Since each subproblem takes constant time to solve, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).

## Space Copmlexity
- The space complexity of the code is also O(m * n). This is due to the creation of the dp matrix, which has a size of (m+1) x (n+1) to store the intermediate results of the LCS computation. The additional space required is proportional to the lengths of word1 and word2.
