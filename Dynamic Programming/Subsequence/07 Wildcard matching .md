**Time Complexity**

- Since we are using memoization to avoid redundant computations, each cell in the memoization table is computed only once.
The total number of cells in the memoization table is (m+1) * (n+1), where m is the length of string s and n is the length of pattern p.
For each cell, the computation takes constant time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).

**Space Coplexity**

- We are using a memoization table of size (m+1) * (n+1) to store the computed results.
Thus, the space complexity is O(m * n) for the memoization table.
Additionally, the recursive function call stack has a maximum depth of m + n.
Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(m * n + m + n) = O(m * n).
