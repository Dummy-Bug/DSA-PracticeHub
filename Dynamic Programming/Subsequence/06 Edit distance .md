```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the minDistance function in the given code is O(m * n), where m is the length of word1 and n is the length of word2. This is because for each combination of indices (i, j) representing the substrings of word1 and word2, we perform a constant amount of work to calculate the minimum edit distance.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is also O(m * n) because we use a memoization array memo of size (m+1) x (n+1) to store the computed results. This array allows us to avoid redundant calculations and retrieve the minimum edit distance in constant time for previously solved subproblems.
