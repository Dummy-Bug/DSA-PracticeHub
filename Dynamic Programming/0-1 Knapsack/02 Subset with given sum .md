**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of the isSubsetSum function in the given code is O(N * target), where N is the size of the array and target is the target sum. This is because for each element in the array, the function considers two cases: including the element or excluding the element. Therefore, the function has to compute and store the results for each combination of elements and target sum.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity of the isSubsetSum function is O(N * target) as well. This is because the function uses a 2D dp table with dimensions (N + 1) x (target + 1) to store the computed values for each subproblem. The table is filled in a bottom-up manner, and each entry in the table requires constant space. Hence, the overall space complexity is proportional to the size of the dp table.

It's important to note that the space complexity can be further optimized to O(target) by using a 1D dp table instead of a 2D table. Since each row of the dp table only depends on the previous row, we can use a single array of size (target + 1) to store the computed values. This optimization reduces the space required but maintains the same time complexity.
