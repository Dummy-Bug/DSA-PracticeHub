**Time Complexity**
- O(N * target)

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It fills a 2D DP table of size (N+1) x (target+1), where N is the size of the input array and target is the given target sum.
Each cell of the DP table is computed only once, taking constant time.
Therefore, the total number of computations is proportional to the number of cells in the DP table, which is (N+1) * (target+1).
Hence, the time complexity is O(N * target).

**Space Complexity**
- O(N * target)

The algorithm uses a 2D DP table of size (N+1) x (target+1) to store the computed values.
The space required to store the DP table is proportional to the number of cells in the table, which is (N+1) * (target+1).
Therefore, the space complexity is O(N * target).
