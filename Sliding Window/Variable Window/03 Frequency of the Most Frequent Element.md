            // If the window is invalid, move the left pointer to make it valid again
            while ((long)(j - i + 1) * nums[j] - sum > k) {
                sum -= nums[i]; // Decrease the sum by the element at the left pointer
                i++; // Move the left pointer to the right
            }
            result = max(result, j - i + 1); // Update the maximum frequency

**Time Complexity**
- The time complexity of the maxFrequency function is O(n log n), where n is the size of the input array nums. This is because the algorithm first sorts the array, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). After sorting, it uses a sliding window approach to iterate through the array once.

**Space Complexity**
- The space complexity of the function is O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables and indices, regardless of the size of the input array.
